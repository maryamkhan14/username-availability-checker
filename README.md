## ðŸ”¥ Up and Coming Features

- Search notifications: If a username you want isn't available, set a frequency for how often the app should check for its availability. When it's available, we'll let you know.
- Instagram, YouTube and Facebook username searches

## ðŸ“¦ Behind the Scenes: Technologies Used

This project uses an Express server to support client requests. For Twitter, Twitch, and Reddit searches, the app uses Axios to make requests to the APIs provided by the respective social media companies. Since Tiktok does not have an easily accessible API, this app crawls Tiktok's website using the automation service Puppeteer to conduct searches.

The frontend uses React (styled with the Material UI framework).

## ðŸ’» Reproduce the Project Locally

To reproduce this project locally, clone this project. Run `npm start`, and the app should be up and running!
